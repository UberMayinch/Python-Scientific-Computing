This is my coursework from the Computing in Sciences 2 course. 
The python notebooks covered the following topics:
1. Probability and Statistics (Simulating Random Walks etc.)
2. Integration (High Dimensional Integration using Monte Carlo Methods, Adaptive Integral sizes)
3. Fourier Series and Epicycles
4. Prey-Predator Model
5. Ising Model
6. Logistic Maps and Chaos
7. Balancing Chemical Reactions
8. Molecular Dynamics (LJ potentials, Metropolis Chain Monte-Carlo)
