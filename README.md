This repository contains the work I have done with scientific computing.

The simulations directory involves work I have been doing for my research. It includes mainly topics related to network science and nonlinear dynamics covered in python or julia.

The CIS directory contains my coursework from the Computing in Sciences 2 course. 
The python notebooks covered the following topics:
1. Probability and Statistics (Simulating Random Walks etc.)
2. Integration (High Dimensional Integration using Monte Carlo Methods, Adaptive Integral sizes)
3. Fourier Series and Epicycles
4. Prey-Predator Model
5. Ising Model
6. Logistic Maps and Chaos
7. Balancing Chemical Reactions
8. Molecular Dynamics (LJ potentials, Metropolis Chain Monte-Carlo)
